# ToDoList-SwiftUI
A To-Do list app made for iOS in Swift UI.

# Description
This is the first complete project in my journey of becoming a self-taught iOS app developer. This is a To-Do list app, which allows for the following functionalities:
- Register an account on the app
- Login with your account
- Add tasks to the list
- Mark tasks as complete or incomplete
- Get the following statistics: total tasks created, tasks completed, tasks completed on time
- See percentages of tasks completed, and tasks completed on time
- Log out

I used Firebase as the backend database for storing tasks and users data. The app was built using the iPhone 14 Pro as a simulator; I have not yet tested this on other devices.

# In action
I consider it best to upload a bunch of screenshots to show the app's layout and working.
